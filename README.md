# ArXiv Topic Modeling

This repository contains the code for a [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) topic model built and trained on ~160,000 ML-related research papers. I used a variety of text pre-processing methods (such as stopword and LaTex equation removal, n-gram phrase identification, and lemmatization) to process the abstracts and built the model using the [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) library.

### Results: Topic clusters

A few of the identified topics are listed below. Note that while the topic terms were generated by the LDA model, the tentative topic titles were added by me after looking at the topic-term distribution.

1. **Algorithms and optimization:** "algorithm", "problem", "search", "optimization", "gradient"
2. **Probabilistic modeling and inference:** "distribution", "bayesian", "inference", "process", "variable"
3. **Natural language processing (NLP):** "language", "text", "semantic", "knowledge", "word"
4. **Computer vision:** "image", "object", "detection", "segmentation", "convolution"
5. **Reinforcement learning:** "agent", "policy", "action", "state", "environment"
6. **Deep learning architectures:** "network", "neural", "deep", "architecture", "layer"
7. **Graph theory:** "graph", "structure", "node", "tree", "edge"
8. **Medicine and healthcare applications** "patient", "covid", "causal", "treatment", "population"

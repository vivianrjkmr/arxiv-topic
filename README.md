# ArXiv Topic Modeling

This repository contains the code for a [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) topic model built and trained on ~160,000 ML-related research papers from the [ArXiv.org dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv) on Kaggle.

The final model achieved a coherence score of 49.9%. While this score is quite low (an ideal coherence score tends to be around 60-80%), the model was able to detect some interesting topic clusters, a few of which are listed below. Note that while the topic terms were generated by the LDA model, the topic titles themselves are subjective, since they were added by me after looking at the term distribution for each of the topics.

1. **Algorithms and optimization:** "algorithm", "problem", "search", "optimization", "gradient"
2. **Probabilistic modeling and inference:** "distribution", "bayesian", "inference", "process", "variable"
3. **Natural language processing (NLP):** "language", "text", "semantic", "knowledge", "word"
4. **Computer vision:** "image", "object", "detection", "segmentation", "convolution"
5. **Reinforcement learning:** "agent", "policy", "action", "state", "environment"
6. **Deep learning architectures:** "network", "neural", "deep", "architecture", "layer"
7. **Graph theory:** "graph", "structure", "node", "tree", "edge"
8. **Medicine and healthcare applications** "patient", "covid", "causal", "treatment", "population"
